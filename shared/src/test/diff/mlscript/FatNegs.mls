class Lit: { n: int }
//│ Defined class Lit

// * Q: What happens if one writes ~Lit instead of ~#Lit?
def nc: ~Lit
def nt: ~#Lit
//│ nc: ~Lit
//│   = <missing implementation>
//│ nt: ~#Lit
//│   = <missing implementation>

// * A: It's not equivalent.

// * Demonstrates that the negated tag is a subtype of the whole negated class:
nc = nt
//│ ~#Lit
//│   <:  nc:
//│ ~Lit
//│   = <no result>
//│     nt is not implemented

// * Demonstrates that the negated tag is not a supertype of the whole negated class:
:e
nt = nc
//│ ~Lit
//│   <:  nt:
//│ ~#Lit
//│ ╔══[ERROR] Type mismatch in def definition:
